# mp42frame.py

This is a Python program that can be used to convert MP4 video files into frames.

## Usage

1. To convert a single MP4 video file into frames:

python mp42frame.py path_to_video/video_name.mp4

The frames will be saved into a folder with the same name as the MP4 file.

2. To convert multiple MP4 video files at once:
python mp42frame.py path_to_video/

The frames will be saved into different folders named after the MP4 files.

Please ensure that the path to the video or the directory is correct to avoid any errors.
